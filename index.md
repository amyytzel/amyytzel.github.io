### CPSC 120L

* Lab 1

    I enjoyed lab 1 because it was such a fun introduction to computer science.  Although I had already known about it since it is a famous code but it was exciting doing it on my own.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was veru memborable because of the road signs.  Transfering information on a roadsign to actual code was very enjoyable especially because it is something I see in my everyday life.  It made me remember my code everytime I see a roadsign.

* Lab 4 

    I enjoyed lab 4 because it was an introduction to doubles.  Converting milliliters to ounces,  I really enjoyed because I had no experiences with milliliters or ounces so I learned a lot more than code during that lab.
